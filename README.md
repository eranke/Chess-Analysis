# Chess-Analysis
A computer analysis of more than a million chess games.

During my work as a laboratory assistant in The Federman Center for the Study of Rationality, I had to analyze via a chess engine millions of different chess positions. Since 
analyzing is a chess position a runtime costly operation, I had to use parallel programming, and use the Hebrew University's super-computers in order to run my program on multiple
CPU's.

# final-sh.txt
this is the batch file I used in order to run my program on the UNIX operating system of the university computers.

# parallel_noGD.R
This is the program I wrote in 'R' for analyzing the chess positions. The program uses the 'R' library "Bigchess" which interfaces with chess engines.
